Abstract
--------

POE::Filter::Snort is a stream filter for POE.  It parses snort alert
logs into hashes, one per alert.  Each hash's fields contain vital
information about its parsed alert.

It's used the way any other POE::Filter class would be.  See the
SYNOPSIS for a complete working example.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

POE::Filter::Snort may be installed through the CPAN shell in the
usual manner.  Typically:

You can also read this README from the CPAN shell:

  cpan> readme POE::Filter::Snort

And you can install the component from the CPAN prompt as well:
